# Heart-Rate-Monitor
This is the project I have done in my 4th semester at the University of Moratuwa. The device I developed is Heart rate monitor, it can measure both pulse rate and temparature.

What you can find here :
- Components
- Schematic Design
- PCB Design
- Enclosure Design
- Software Integration

## Usage
- Power ON the device
- Use the buttons to navigate through the menu options on the LCD screen
- Choose the desired measurement mode from the menu:
  - Heart rate
  - Temparature
- Follow the on-screen instructions to perform measurements
- View the measurement results on the LCD screen

## Components
- Pulse rate sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Microcontroller
- LCD display
- Power supply unit
- Custom-designed PCB
- 3D-printed enclosure

## Schematic Design
The pulse rate sensor and temperature sensor are connected to a microcontroller that processes the data. The microcontroller then displays the information on an LCD screen for easy reading.

## PCB Design
I have designed a 2 layer PCB for this device using Altium software. The PCB design involved creating a custom circuit board layout that ensures efficient connections and a compact arrangement of components. This design minimizes noise interference and facilitates easy assembly.

## Enclosure Design
I have designed a 3D-printed enclosure useing Solidworks software, to the ergonomic and compact enclosure not only protects the delicate components but also ensures user comfort and convenience during measurement.

## Software Integration
The software aspect involves programming the microcontroller to manage data from the sensors and display it on the LCD. I have used Arduino IDE for progamming the microcontroller.
